Kinetic Simulation Of Dijkstra's Algorithm.
I wrote this code 1 afternoon after watching a lecture by an MIT professor on Dijkstra's Algorithm.
He simulated the algorithm using balls and a thread.

The code works similarly
The current simulation works for solving the following graph.

You can modify the code accordingly for other graph's as well.
